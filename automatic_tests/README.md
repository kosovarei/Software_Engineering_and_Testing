# oblig3_software

what i did:
* made a new git repository in my account
* opened it on pycharm
* added my function and test from oblig2
* made a .github directory with a workflows directory in it
* made a run_tests.yamel file inside the workflows directory
* added pyproject.toml to make it work
* renamed the test file from test to test_function, so it gets detected
